# Infrared-small-target-tracking
This is a general infrared small target tracking algorithm, belongs to plug and play module.
I have uploaded two experimental videos, including Video 1 and Video 2.
In video 1 and 2, it can be seen that under the interference of complex background, DJI UAV can be tracked in real time, and there are almost no false alarms and missed detection.
